Read and write to INI files in VB.NET and CSharp

The origianl code was created by Ludvik Jerabek (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21896/INI-Reader-Writer-Class-for-C-VB-NET-and-VBScript)

Apart from this, I did somechanges myself to make it more powerful:

- Added support for UTF8 encoding (Optional encoding support too)
- Added support to read a INI file with optional default result (in case that the key ins't available)
- Fixed a problem that can read/write ini files in a random order.
- Some minor fixes.
